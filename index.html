        <h2> Biography</h2>
        <p>Sidharth Sarangi is a 20-year-old classical guitarist, pianist and composer from Odisha, India. <br> <br>
    Sidharth started guitar lessons aged 9 in the Rock and Pop style. Gradually he developed an interest in the western classical style and started learning classical guitar.  
Sidharth has since won prizes at several national and international competitions. He stood first at the Global Guitar Gita international guitar festival and competition where he was the winner of the Grand Prize. He was also a winner at the Calcutta International Classical Guitar Festival and Competition in 2018.

Sidharth’s repertoire consists of eclectic and diverse pieces ranging from original arrangements of Bach’s keyboard partitas to more modern music by composers such as Gary Ryan, Sergio Assad, Leo Brouwer, Pavel Steidl and Frederic Rzewski. His affinity for avant garde pieces is evident in his transcriptions and interpretations of pieces by modern composers.  
<br><br> Sidharth has performed at some of the most prestigious venues all over India. Highlights include solo recitals at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai, the Bangalore International Centre, ICCR Calcutta, Galeria de Belas Artes in Goa, the Cottage Chamber Concert series in Mysore, among others.<br><br> Lately, Sidharth has also been active in pedagogy, and has been actively conducting workshops and masterclasses in an effort to promote the classical guitar repertoire amongst other guitarists and musicians in general.  
<br><br> Recently, Sidharth was invited to perform at NPR's Great American Folk Show hosted by singer-songwriter and guitarist Thomas Brosseau where his performance was aired live on the Prairie Public radio channel.
<br><br>In addition to performance, Sidharth also composes and arranges from time to time and has written and arranged pieces for the solo guitar and piano repertoire. Sidharth is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in electronics engineering and enjoys swimming in his free time.
